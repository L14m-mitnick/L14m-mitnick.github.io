Hi , my name is Liam. Welcome to my personal website.I'm a security engineer during day and a vigilant hacker at night.

### Location
Currently i'm located in Toronto, Canada. I currently work at Cybersafe.

### Experience
I'm not a elite and most wanted hacker like Kevin , neither a script kiddie, usually I hack everything around me. **Stay away from me and be safe, I might inject virus.** 

### Eductaion

### Conferences

### Security tips
* Use a password atleast with 15 characters with Uppercase , lower case, numbers and special characters.
* Be aware of malicious sites and dont download anything suspicious from internet.
* It's enought to exploit the Weakest link to compromise anything, and unfortunately humans are the weakest links.....Yeah don't fall for phishing attack, check the URL
* There's nothing called super secure and unbreachable, if you want to be one then dont connect your machine with internet (only way)

### CTF's
Yeah I love CTF's, It makes me forget everything. Don't you think it's addictive??, I do.
