## Liam mitnick


Hi , my name is Liam. Welcome to my personal website.I'm a security engineer during day and a vigilant hacker at night.

### Location
Currently i'm located in Toronto, Canada. I currently work at Cybersafe.

### Experience
I'm not a elite and most wanted hacker like Kevin , neither a script kiddie, usually I hack everything around me. **Stay away from me and be safe, I might inject virus.** 

### Eductaion
I graduated with a degree of cybersecurity from university of Toronto, Toronto in 2010. Yeah Toronto!!

I hold the following certifications
* OSCP
* RHCSA
* CCNA

### Conferences
I've participated in these conferences 

* DEFCON 2020
* Blackhat USA
* Linux.conf

### Security tips
* Use a password atleast with 15 characters with Uppercase , lower case, numbers and special characters.
* Be aware of malicious sites and dont download anything suspicious from internet.
* It's just enough to exploit the Weakest link to compromise any system, and unfortunately humans are the weakest links.....Yeah don't fall for phishing attack, check the URL and be sure you are entering your credentials to a proper site
* There's nothing called super secure and unbreachable, if you want to be one then dont connect your machine with internet (only way)

### CTF's
Yeah I love CTF's, It makes me forget everything. Don't you think it's addictive??, I do.

Try these, if you're interested
* Pico CTF (if you're a begginer and don't know what a CTF is)
* Try hackme
* Hack The Box
* You can find list on ongoing and past CTF [here](https://ctftime.org)
